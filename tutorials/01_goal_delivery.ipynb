    "\n",
    "- Understand the CoGames environment structure\n",
    "- Learn how agents interact via the **move** action\n",
    "- Train a policy with sparse rewards\n",
    "- Visualize learning progress\n",
    "- Interpret value functions\n",

    "## 📋 Task Overview\n",

    "**Starting State:**\n",
    "- Agent spawns randomly in a 10x10 map\n",
    "- Agent starts with 3 hearts in inventory\n",
    "- One chest is placed randomly on the map\n",

    "- Navigate to the chest\n",
    "- Deposit hearts by moving into the chest\n",
    "- Maximize reward: +1 per heart deposited\n",

    "## 🎓 Summary and Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've trained your first CoGames agent. Here's what we learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concepts\n",
    "1. **Sparse Rewards**: The agent only receives reward when depositing hearts\n",
    "2. **Move Action**: Agents interact with objects by moving into them from valid positions\n",
    "3. **Agent-Specific Stats**: `heart.lost` tracks rewards per agent (vs global stats)\n",
    "4. **Navigation Learning**: The policy learned spatial relationships between agent and chest\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Results\n",
    "- ✅ Agent learned to navigate to chest consistently\n",
    "- ✅ Episode length decreased (more efficient paths)\n",
    "- ✅ Return increased to ~3.0 (depositing all 3 hearts)\n",
    "- ✅ Value function shows spatial understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps: Tutorial 2 - Simple Assembly\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next tutorial, we'll increase complexity:\n",
    "- **Add crafting**: Agent must craft hearts from raw resources\n",
    "- **Multi-step planning**: Navigate to assembler → craft → navigate to chest → deposit\n",
    "- **Resource management**: Limited materials require efficient use\n",
    "- **Longer episodes**: More exploration needed\n",
