## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Transfer Learning by Default
- Automatically detects previous checkpoints
- Falls back to training from scratch gracefully
- Clear feedback on which path is used

### 2. Separate Checkpoint Directories
- `./checkpoints/` for Tutorial 1
- `./checkpoints_stage2/` for Tutorial 2
- `./checkpoints_stage3_single/` for Tutorial 3 Part A
- `./checkpoints_stage3_multi/` for Tutorial 3 Part B

**Rationale:** Prevents accidental overwriting, enables comparison

### 3. Simplified Reward Structure
- Uses `heart.lost` (agent-specific) instead of `chest.heart.amount` (global)
- Clear per-agent credit assignment
- Works for both single and multi-agent

### 4. Crafting Event Tracking
- Infers crafting from heart inventory increases
- Lightweight (doesn't require env modification)
- Enables subtask visualization

### 5. Progressive Difficulty
- Each tutorial adds ONE major concept
- Clear success criteria
- Reuses knowledge from previous tutorials
