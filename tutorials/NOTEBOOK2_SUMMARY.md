## üîë Key Technical Decisions

### Transfer Learning Implementation

**Checkpoint Detection Logic:**
```python
stage1_checkpoint_dir = Path("./checkpoints/cogames.cogs_vs_clips")
stage1_checkpoints = sorted(stage1_checkpoint_dir.glob("*.pt"))

if stage1_checkpoints:
    initial_weights_path = str(stage1_checkpoints[-1])  # Use latest
else:
    initial_weights_path = None  # Train from scratch
```

**Benefits:**
- Users who complete Tutorial 1 automatically get transfer learning
- Users who skip Tutorial 1 can still complete Tutorial 2
- Clear feedback on which path is being used

### Crafting Configuration

**Simplified Recipe:**
- 1C + 1O + 1Ge + 1Si ‚Üí 1 Heart
- Approach from any direction (`["Any"]`)
- No cooldown (can craft every step)
- Agent starts with 5 of each resource = max 5 hearts

**Why this configuration:**
- Simple 1:1:1:1 ratio is easy to understand
- "Any" direction reduces action space complexity
- Low cooldown allows rapid experimentation
- 5 hearts possible = clear success signal

### Separate Checkpoint Directory

**Decision:** Use `./checkpoints_stage2/` instead of `./checkpoints/`

**Rationale:**
- Keeps Stage 1 and Stage 2 checkpoints separate
- Prevents overwriting Stage 1 checkpoints
- Makes it easy to compare policies
- Allows parallel experimentation

---

## üìä Expected Results

### Success Metrics
- **Average Return:** 2.0-5.0 (2-5 hearts deposited)
- **Success Rate:** 60%+ (‚â•2 hearts)
- **Episode Length:** 80-150 steps
- **Training Time:** ~5-7 minutes on CPU

### Transfer Learning Impact
- **With transfer:** ~30% faster convergence, ~15% higher final return
- **Without transfer:** Still learns, just takes longer

### Learning Curve
- **0-10k steps:** Random exploration, occasional success
- **10-20k steps:** Reliable assembler navigation
- **20-40k steps:** Learning craft ‚Üí deposit sequence
- **40-50k steps:** Consistent multi-step execution

---

## üéì Educational Value

### Concepts Taught

1. **Multi-Step Planning**
   - Agent must chain actions: navigate ‚Üí craft ‚Üí navigate ‚Üí deposit
   - Requires temporal credit assignment
   - More complex than single-step tasks

2. **Transfer Learning**
   - Practical demonstration of knowledge reuse
   - Shows concrete benefits (faster, better)
   - Encourages good ML practices

3. **Resource Management**
   - Agent must track inventory state
   - Conditional actions based on resources
   - Planning with constraints

4. **Crafting Systems**
   - Unique mechanic in CoGames
   - Action-triggered state changes
   - Recipe-based transformations

### Pedagogical Flow

```
Tutorial 1: Navigate ‚Üí Deposit
              ‚Üì (add complexity)
Tutorial 2: Navigate ‚Üí Craft ‚Üí Navigate ‚Üí Deposit
              ‚Üì (add foraging)
Tutorial 3: Forage ‚Üí Craft ‚Üí Deposit (+ multi-agent)
```

Each tutorial builds on previous knowledge while adding ONE major new concept.

## üîß Implementation Details

### Differences from Tutorial 1

| Aspect | Tutorial 1 | Tutorial 2 | Reasoning |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Map Size | 10x10 | 12x12 | More exploration needed |
| Initial Inventory | 3 hearts | 5 resources | Must craft hearts |
| Training Steps | 20k | 50k | More complex task |
| Objects | 1 chest | 1 assembler + 1 chest | Two locations |
| Episode Max | 200 | 300 | Longer task |
| Checkpoint Dir | `./checkpoints/` | `./checkpoints_stage2/` | Keep separate |

### New Imports

```python
from mettagrid.config.mettagrid_config import RecipeConfig

from tutorial_viz import (
    plot_crafting_subtasks,    # NEW (placeholder)
    plot_inventory_timeline,   # NEW (placeholder)
    # ... existing imports
)
```

### New Visualizations (Placeholders)

- `plot_crafting_subtasks()` - Track assembler visits, crafts, deposits
- `plot_inventory_timeline()` - Show resource flow over episode

These are imported but not fully implemented yet. Current version uses inference from returns.

## üß™ Testing Checklist

Before considering Notebook 2 "done":

- [ ] Run notebook from start to finish
- [ ] Test WITH Stage 1 checkpoint (transfer learning path)
- [ ] Test WITHOUT Stage 1 checkpoint (from-scratch path)
- [ ] Verify training completes without errors
- [ ] Check Stage 2 checkpoints are created in separate directory
- [ ] Verify policy loads from Stage 2 checkpoint
- [ ] Verify evaluation runs successfully
- [ ] Check plots display correctly
- [ ] Verify success rate > 50%
- [ ] Compare transfer learning vs from-scratch performance

---

## üí° Future Enhancements

### Immediate (Can add now)
1. **Subtask tracking implementation**
   - Modify `evaluate_policy()` to track environment state
   - Count assembler visits, crafting events
   - Visualize subtask completion rates

2. **Inventory timeline**
   - Track resources and hearts over episode
   - Plot stacked area chart showing resource flow
   - Visualize craft events as markers

### Advanced (Requires more work)
1. **Value function for multi-location tasks**
   - Show high values at BOTH assembler and chest
   - Color code by task stage (pre-craft vs post-craft)

2. **Attention visualization**
   - Which objects does agent "attend to"?
   - Heatmap of observation weights

3. **Failure mode analysis**
   - Classify failure types (can't find assembler, can't craft, can't deposit)
   - Help users debug training issues

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Option 1: Test Notebook 2
Run the notebook end-to-end to verify:
- Transfer learning works correctly
- Training converges
- Visualizations display properly

### Option 2: Implement Notebook 3
Continue with the final tutorial:
- Add foraging (resource extraction)
- Scale to multi-agent (2-4 agents)
- Add coordination metrics

### Option 3: Enhance Visualizations
Implement the placeholder visualizations:
- Subtask completion tracking
- Resource inventory timeline
- Multi-agent coordination metrics
